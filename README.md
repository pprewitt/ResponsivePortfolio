# Responsive Portfolio

The assigment was to create a responsive website with bootstrap, which includes:
   
   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images

## Discussion

I went with a relatively simple, but attractive design. One image "background mental health" was retrieved from (https://www.pexels.com/photo/adult-black-and-white-darkness-face-1161268/) a free stock photography site. the remaining pictures are my own. I am not sure if we were allowed to include javascript from bootstrap, but without it, the navbar hamburger would not work when viewport is collapsed. Placeholder cards were left in the portfolio page to add forthcoming projects from this class. Images are set to be links, except for the Jumbotron and the coming soon portfolio projects. I understood from the instructor that making the contact form functional was out of scope as we have not gone over the necessary scripting required. I really enjoy the bootstrap framework, it makes adjusting the styling a lot more of a creative exercise than a coding task.
