# Responsive Portfolio

The assigment was to create a responsive website with bootstrap, which includes:
   
   * A navbar
   * A responsive layout
   * Responsive images

## Discussion

I went with a relatively simple, but attractive design. One image "background mental health" was retrieved from (https://www.pexels.com/photo/adult-black-and-white-darkness-face-1161268/) a free stock photography site. the remaining pictures are my own. I understood from the instructor that making the contact form functional was out of scope as we have not gone over the necessary scripting required. I really enjoy the bootstrap framework, it makes adjusting the styling a lot more of a creative exercise than a coding task.
